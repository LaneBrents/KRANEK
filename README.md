---


Kraniak allows students and regular users to have a fun and simple way of studying material and content. Whatever subject or topic that may be.
Kraniak will allow students and teachers to create study decks and
quizzes that can be created into a game, which will help students retain new information easier.
These then can be shared between users to easily share created decks and quizzes.
